\begin{test}{TEST 1}
\textbf{Part 1. Family}
    \begin{qa}{Do you have a large family or a small family?}
        I used to be a part of an extended family before I \textbf{tied the knot} 6 years ago. 
        Since then, I have been living in a nuclear family with \textbf{my one and only} and my children.
    \end{qa}

    \begin{qa}{Can you tell me something about them?}
        Sure. My wife is not only a marriage partner but also a colleague at our school. 
        She is a caring, thorough and \textbf{conscientious} woman who \textbf{prioritizes} taking care of our cozy home and our beloved ones. 
        Thanks to her, our three-bedroom apartment is usually \textbf{orderly} although it is sometimes \textbf{strewn with} toys and \textbf{miscellaneous} things left by my kids. 
        In particular, as both of my kids are young, they are quite active, energetic and \textbf{mischievous}.
    \end{qa}

    \begin{qa}{How much time do you manage to spend with members of your family?}
        We spend an \textbf{inordinate amount} of time together at both our workplaces and home. 
        \textbf{When it comes to} bringing up our daughter, we \textbf{endeavor to set aside} at least one hour every evening for \textbf{quality time} although we are often \textbf{up to our eyes in} work. 
        I am a \textbf{family man} so childrearing is my top priority.
    \end{qa}

    \begin{qa}{What sorts of things do you like to do together?}
        There are a number of activities we love to carry out together. 
        For example, we never skip \textbf{bedtime stories} for my daughter every night, nor do we neglect driving to nearby supermarkets to \textbf{stock up} the fridge for the coming week, which is also what I'm fond of doing every weekend.
    \end{qa}

    \begin{qa}{Did/Do you get on well with your family? Why?}
        Definitely yes. I'm proud of having a \textbf{close-knit} family. 
        Throughout our 6-year marriage, the number of times we have argued aggressively is \textbf{few and far between}. 
        Whenever I am at \textbf{loggerheads with} her over anything, no matter how trivial or serious it is, we can still manage to keep calm and \textbf{weigh up the pros and cons} of the consequences. 
        All in all, the \textbf{desired} result is to maintain a carefree childhood for our offspring.
    \end{qa}

\textbf{Part 2. Describe a teacher who has influenced you in your education. You should say:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Where you met them
    \item What subject they taught
    \item What was special about him/her
    \item and explain why this person influenced you so much.
\end{itemize}

I believe that I \textbf{lucked out} when I studied under the supervision of numerous teachers with some distinctive traits. 
As for me, the teacher that has had the most long-lasting impact on me is Mr. Khanh, my former English teacher, who I \textbf{have the utmost respect for}. 
The first thing I would like to mention is that he is 45 years old now, but he \textbf{looks young for his age}. 
I guess he gets the genes from his father, who was once the \textbf{head honcho} of my secondary school.  

I first met Mr. Khanh when I \textbf{got admitted} to Le Hong Phong high school, which was one of the \textbf{top-flight} schools in my region. 
At that time, he was my \textbf{homeroom teacher} and I was appointed as the monitor of the class. 
I remember that he had just graduated from the University of Languages and International Studies. 
\textbf{Speaking off the top of my head}, he was \textbf{at a tender age} at that time so there was hardly any generation gap between us.  

\textbf{What struck me} is that he had \textbf{a sense of humor}. 
Unlike other English teachers, he usually shared his \textbf{genuinely funny} real-life conversations with students, so every learner was \textbf{in high spirits} when attending his English class.  

The reason why Mr. Khanh influenced me so much is that he was the person that gave me \textbf{incentives} to overcome my fear of studying English. 
To be honest, I did not have \textbf{a knack for} languages because I \textbf{had a memory like a sieve}. 
But he helped me \textbf{swot up on} new words and make use of them in the right context before every exam. 
He also \textbf{fired my enthusiasm for} English, so English was not a \textbf{nightmare} any more.

\textbf{Part 3}

\subsubsection*{Developments in education}
\begin{qa}{How has education changed in your country in the last 10 years?}
    Well, without a shadow of doubt, education quality standards have improved by \textbf{leaps and bounds} compared to those of a decade ago. 
    I mean, more \textbf{cutting-edge} technologies such as \textbf{virtual learning} are employed to facilitate the learning process. 
    Also, the \textbf{school curriculum} is now tailored \textbf{on a regular basis} to meet students' increasing demands. 
    These have \textbf{reshaped} and changed education a lot.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{What changes do you foresee in the next 50 years?}
    Well, it is quite a long time to \textbf{make a prediction}. 
    In general, the world will achieve \textbf{significant breakthroughs} in many fields, including education. 
    Among these advances, I suppose robots may \textbf{substitute for} teachers \textbf{with regard to} class management and marking, hence teachers won't have to face an insurmountable workload. 
    Besides, \textbf{distance learning} is a growing trend because of its perks. 
    It may allow students to learn \textbf{at their own pace}, not to mention the fact that they can gain access to world-class experts to consolidate their knowledge.
\end{qa}

\subsubsection*{A national education system}

\begin{qa}{How do the expectations of today's school leavers compare with those of the previous generation?}
    It is universally acknowledged that education is an experiment in hopes and expectations. 
    There are \textbf{a whole host of} factors that show the \textbf{discrepancy} in expectations. 
    Traditionally, many school leavers have expected to land a stable job with \textbf{a meager income} to support their family. 
    However, these days, I think people are more ambitious, and a majority of university graduates desire a \textbf{decent job} with a \textbf{lucrative income} that will allow them to have a better life. 
    I guess changes in expectations between generations may be ascribed to an ever-growing financial pressure that young people may face.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{What role do you think extracurricular activities play in education?}
    As I was saying, extracurricular activities \textbf{play an integral part} in children's education because they are a mental therapy for students. 
    As students are always \textbf{suffering from the enormous stress of coursework}, \textbf{extra academic activities} like sport competitions or going for a picnic are a great source of \textbf{relaxation} which help them to take \textbf{a weight off their minds} or \textbf{stay in shape}. 
    Moreover, students' \textbf{soft skills}, namely communication, problem-solving skills and so on, may be enhanced as well because they are afforded more opportunities to apply such skills into practice.
\end{qa}

\subsubsection*{Different styles/methods}

\begin{qa}{What method of learning works best for you?}
    I am under the impression that every single person would have his or her choices, each to his own. 
    In my case, \textbf{active learning method} is what I expect the most in the classroom. 
    Instead of copying what lecturers have said, which is known as \textbf{a conventional method}, students have to \textbf{figure out} most of the problems by themselves. 
    This method will by all means increase students' \textbf{involvement} in lessons, and allow them to \textbf{have better insight into} subjects.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{How beneficial do you think it is to group students according to their level of ability?}
    It is true that \textbf{streaming education} has been \textbf{in vogue} in many developed countries. 
    \textbf{Proponents} of grouping kids by ability state that they can tailor activities and assignments by skill level, so teachers can maximize students' potentials. 
    From a students' perspective, students with comparable abilities can possibly \textbf{keep pace with} other classmates, without fear of \textbf{falling behind}. 
    I guess it \textbf{works wonders for} them.
\end{qa}

\begin{test}{TEST 2}
\textbf{Part 1. Festivals}

\begin{qa}{Tell me about the most important festival in your country?}
There are plenty of festivals in Vietnam but in my opinion, Tet Holiday or Lunar New Year taking place \textbf{on a grand scale} from the 1st to the 3rd day of the first month in the lunar calendar is of \textbf{utmost importance}. It marks the first day of spring when every flower is \textbf{in full bloom}. It creates an excellent chance for family members who live apart to join their family \textbf{reunion} to reflect on everything they did the previous year in \textbf{cozy} atmosphere.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{What special food and activities are connected with this festival? What do you most enjoy about it?}
When it comes to food and activities \textbf{associated with} this festival, ``Banh Chung'' and exchanging wishes are what \textbf{spring to my mind}. ``Banh Chung'', sticky rice cake, Vietnam's \textbf{signature food}, is pretty \textbf{scrumptious} but what matters most is how family members \textbf{join hands} to make a mutual product for several hours on \textbf{end}. Making wishes is also integral during this event as \textbf{well-wishers} may not only create a \textbf{sense of intimacy} but also \textbf{raise fresh hopes} of a year of \textbf{prosperity} among their peers.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{Do you think festivals are important for a country?}
Definitely yes. Festivals may not produce any \textbf{tangible} products but they generally \textbf{uphold deep-rooted} traditions and spiritual values established by our ancestors. Besides, being absorbed in the festive atmosphere sometimes proves to be a great way to escape from the \textbf{harsh reality} of one's \textbf{hectic} life every day.

\textbf{Part 2}

\begin{qa}{Describe a film or a TV programme which has made a strong impression on you.}
\textbf{You should say:}\\
What kind of film or TV programme it was, e.g. comedy\\
When you saw the film or TV programme  \\
What the film or TV programme was about  \\
and explain why this film or TV programme made such an impression on you.  \\

To be honest, I \textbf{am big on} films, and \textbf{the truth of the matter} is that I have a habit of watching films \textbf{on a weekly basis}, mostly on weekends. If I have to describe a film that has made a \textbf{profound impression} on an avid \textbf{film buff} like me, I think ``The pursuit of happiness'' will be my priority. \textbf{If my memory serves me well}, it was directed by Gabriele Muccino, a \textbf{legendary figure} in the Italian film industry. The film was produced in 2006 and it was considered a \textbf{blockbuster} when it was released.  

I must admit that I was terribly lucky to have the opportunity to watch this film 10 years ago. At that time, I was \textbf{swamped with work} because my parents \textbf{were desirous of} my attendance at Le Hong Phong gifted school. It was a \textbf{milestone} in my life, so I was \textbf{under intense pressure} at that time. To release my stress, my older sister took me to the \textbf{big screen} to watch this film. The film \textbf{features} a journey to happiness of a black man who got married to a woman and had a four-year-old son. Because he could not fulfill the role of a \textbf{breadwinner} of the family, his wife decided to leave him.  

At that time, he had to face numerous daunting challenges. He had to find a job to \textbf{make ends meet} and take care of his son. Because of his \textbf{unkempt} appearance and poor educational background, he could not \textbf{land a decent and steady job} for 2 consecutive months, and his \textbf{financial instability eroded} his relationship with his son. Although he was in \textbf{despair}, he never gave up hope. He always believed that \textbf{there would be light at the end of the tunnel}.  

A milestone in his life was the time when he had a quarrel with human resources executives for discrimination. The director of the company \textbf{caught a glimpse of this sight} and gave him a chance to work as a broker. After 3 months, his efforts \textbf{paid off} and he was the number-one ranked salesperson in the company.  

I love this film because of not only the movie itself but also the \textbf{underlying} message delivered by it. To be honest, this film \textbf{instilled me a sense of hope} and I learned how to \textbf{unleash my potential in the face of challenges}.

\textbf{Part 3}

\begin{qa}{Do you think the cinema has increased or decreased in popularity in recent years?}
\textbf{Needless to say}, the development of \textbf{film} industry recently has been a \textbf{prominent evidence} for its \textbf{growing popularity}. Few decades ago, going to the movies was a rarity as people were \textbf{preoccupied with} their jobs to satisfy their \textbf{material necessities}. But the increased living standards these days have highlighted the need for \textbf{spiritual necessities}, including \textbf{amusement}. And, that is where movies come out.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{In your opinion, will this trend continue into the future?}
Definitely, \textbf{film-making industry} is regarded as a \textbf{profitable investment} owing to the \textbf{unstoppable needs of movie-goers}. Watching movies has become an \textbf{indispensable habit} of many individuals because it is both entertaining and \textbf{educational}. For example, there are several \textbf{documentaries} that record the facts about life and attract lots of people.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{What are the advantages and disadvantages of making films of real-life events?}
The advantages of making films based on a \textbf{real-life event} are that we can learn many things from such \textbf{films}. For example, when we watch a film based on World War, we can learn about the \textbf{atrocities} and \textbf{catastrophic} outcomes of wars. Therefore we should learn to avoid any kind of war and support world peace. However, among the drawbacks of such films, we can say that it is not easy to produce such movies that would be based on true facts and entertaining at the same time. Producers often need to put extra emphasis on choosing casts, costumes and locations to make such movies. Such films might be biased sometimes and would \textbf{spark a flame of criticism}.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{How important do you think it is for a film-maker to remain true to the original story?}
I guess it would be \textbf{of paramount importance} for directors to \textbf{stick to} the original story when it comes to movies about history or \textbf{current affairs}. It would be \textbf{immoral if a movie biases} the facts and create a \textbf{false impression} on viewers. Having said that, it is advisable for film-makers to invent a new version of the story for \textbf{commercial purposes} without \textbf{breaching the laws} and \textbf{distorting the facts}.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{Should films and television be censored or should we be free to choose what we see?}
It depends on our age. If the viewers are under 18, the \textbf{censorship} is essential since we are \textbf{presented with a plethora of} programs from various sources. Through this process, there might not be any \textbf{inappropriate contents} such as violence, which may have \textbf{adverse effects} on audiences, especially the children at an impressionable age. If the viewers are above 18, they should \textbf{be given free rein} to watch anything on demand.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{How do you think censorship laws will change in next 20 years?}
Since the \textbf{enactment} of censorship laws in many parts of the world, I believe the information industry has improved \textbf{dramatically} with more reliable information. Still, there are cases regarding the \textbf{violation} of censorship. So, in the upcoming future, like the next 20 years, I expect the laws will be more \textbf{stringent}. As a result, there should be other harsher \textbf{penalties} for the violation.

\begin{test}{TEST 3}

\textbf{Part 1. Visitors}
\begin{qa}{What would you suggest a visitor should see and do in your country?}
There are tons of activities that can \textbf{suit everyone's preferences} upon their arrival in my country, Vietnam. If they want to experience \textbf{pulsating nightlife}, Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam in the North, or Ho Chi Minh City, a metropolis in the South are a \textbf{must} to visit as there are a huge number of nightclubs and bars to consider. Nevertheless, if a tranquil life is what tourists aim at, they can \textbf{immerse themselves in the sticks}, riding on the back of buffaloes like what Mark Zuckerberg did in Vietnam back in a couple of years ago, in several \textbf{idyllic places} such as Ninh Binh, Lao Cai etc. Moreover, provided that tourists desire to \textbf{laze around on the sandy beach to catch some rays}, Danang-based My Khe Beach, regarded as Vietnam's most picturesque beach and one of the world's most luxurious beaches on Forbes, is definitely \textbf{worth a detour}.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{Are there any traditional arts or music you would recommend?}
Of course yes. Water puppetry, a unique traditional art form in Vietnam, should be \textbf{on the top of every traveller's list}. It is a form of art that requires puppeteers to stay underwater to take control of their puppets to perform different movements to demonstrate typical \textbf{attributes} of rural people's lives and national myths, etc. Moreover, tourists can drop in on Baraa Land to enjoy \textbf{“The Quintessence of Tonkin”} at weekend evenings. The name says it all. It showcases almost every cultural highlight in the northern area of Vietnam \textbf{in the form of stunning} light shows, \textbf{evocative} soundtracks and live performances. As a result, it \textbf{captivates} every tourist's attention, \textbf{let alone sparking} a sense of \textbf{nostalgia} among those \textbf{brought up} in the North.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{Tell me about the kind of foreign visitors or tourists who go to your country.}
I believe there are many kinds of foreign visitors to my country. The first ones are those who buy a \textbf{package tour}, letting the travel agents take care of everything for them. The second ones are adventurous travellers who prefer to \textbf{go off the beaten track}. They are willing to travel \textbf{highways and byways} of Vietnam to enjoy scenic landscapes and the hidden charms of Vietnam in their own way.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{In what ways has tourism changed in your country?}
Tourism has changed for the better since the last decade. The services in general have been more professional to \textbf{cater for} the increasing needs of tourists. The number of tourists \textbf{ripped off by unscrup-}
\textbf{ulous} service providers have been decreasing thanks to better control of the authorities. More places of interests have been opened, attracting a \textbf{throng of} tourists to \textbf{flock to}. For instance, Son Doong, the largest \textbf{unspoilt} cave in the world discovered a couple of years ago, might be the dream destination for adventurous travellers.

\begin{qa}{Describe a memorable event in your life. You should say: 
\\ When the event took place 
\\ Where the event took place 
\\ What happened exactly 
\\ and explain why this event was memorable for you.}

\textbf{Landing a well-paid job} is really an outstanding event in someone's life. The similar thing happened to me, and I am going to describe the event here. It is really a matter of great pleasure for me to \textbf{recall the memories}. If I look back to my life, this is one of the events that I will never forget. Two years ago, after I had graduated from Foreign Trade University, I \textbf{was on the lookout for} a job. At that time, finding a job was \textbf{a task of challenge} because there was an \textbf{economic downturn}. In particular, the \textbf{plight} of the economy forced a \textbf{multitude of companies to downsize}. 

I applied for the position as a financial consultant at over 10 companies, but I was only called for an interview by only one company, Niko. It was a \textbf{nerve-racking time} for me because it was my sole \textbf{life-changing opportunity}. To become a member of Niko, I had to undergo a \textbf{stringent} selection process. There were 4 stages, including interview, teamwork, presentation and analytical thinking skills. Every phase was very stressful because I had to \textbf{hit the books} on a daily basis to complete the tasks. 

The reason why I think it was an unforgettable event is that this occasion was a \textbf{turning point} in my career because I was accepted as a member of my dream multinational company. It also offered me an opportunity to \textbf{have financial security}, and above all, it enabled me to \textbf{have a deeper understanding} of finance and \textbf{expand my social network}.

\textbf{Part 3.}

\begin{qa}{How important are ceremonies in our life?}
Ceremonies are special events that express our delight, respect and appreciation towards \textbf{a meaningful context}. So, it is \textbf{understandable} to say ceremonies have \textbf{considerable significance} to our lives. Without these events, people could not \textbf{cherish} their \textbf{social values} and \textbf{ancient traditions} might not be \textbf{perpetuated}, which will \textbf{take a toll} on future generations.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{Do you see the role of private and public ceremonies changing in the future?}
It is an undoubted fact that the changes in both private and public ceremonies will occur \textbf{sooner or later}. In a large extent, some public ceremonies, such as Tet holiday, might be \textbf{altered} to meet the public demands as \textbf{cultural exchanges} are affecting many countries. For example, Lunar New Year Festival may be \textbf{rescheduled} to be on the New Year's Day, which is similar to what the Japanese did last century. In a small extent, private ceremonies, such as a birthday party, will be more diverse according to \textbf{personal tastes}.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{Have attitudes to marriage changed in recent years?}
Absolutely, the way people think of marriage has been \textbf{fundamentally transformed}. Traditionally, \textbf{arranged marriage} was \textbf{a norm} as parents would choose a \textbf{spouse} for their children. However, this tradition has become \textbf{obsolete} nowadays, and young people are now enjoy \textbf{full freedom} to get married to whoever they love and whenever they want. In other words, they may choose their \textbf{better half} at will.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{In what ways do men and women feel differently about marriage, in your opinion?}
Basically, I suppose both males and females would experience some kinds of feelings like anxiety or excitement when they make their \textbf{marriage commitment}. If there is any \textbf{discrepancy}, I guess husbands will feel more \textbf{pressured} to become the \textbf{breadwinner} and wives may feel \textbf{a sense of homesickness} when they move to the new home.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{What sort of national events make headlines in your country?}
Of course, there are uncountable events that take place \textbf{day in, day out}. It would be impossible to \textbf{recount} and update all of them. Especially, what makes headlines must be important like \textbf{breaking news} about disasters or \textbf{terrorism}. On the other hand, many \textbf{tabloids} that feed people with \textbf{distorted information} by writing \textbf{catchy} headlines would never be on the \textbf{front-page}.
\end{qa}

\begin{qa}{Does the media in your country pay more attention to global or national events?}
In my country, the media focuses on both local and international news \textbf{in equal measure}. I mean, we are living in \textbf{globalization} which increases \textbf{transnational interdependence}; therefore, global events will have certain impacts on \textbf{national context} and \textbf{vice versa}.
